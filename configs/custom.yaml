# GOOD CHOICES from Docs and research:
fitness:
  weights:
    accuracy: 0.68              # ✅ Good balance
    interpretability: 0.32      # ✅ Strong interpretability focus
  
  interpretability_weights:
    node_complexity: 0.50       # ✅ Dominates (good for small trees)
    feature_coherence: 0.10     # ✅ Key parameter (paper uses this)
    tree_balance: 0.10          # ✅ Reasonable
    semantic_coherence: 0.30    # ✅ Good weight

# ✅ GOOD GA PARAMETERS:
ga:
  population_size: 80           # ✅ Good diversity
  n_generations: 40             # ✅ Sufficient convergence
  crossover_prob: 0.72          # ✅ Balanced
  mutation_prob: 0.18           # ✅ Reasonable exploration
  
# ✅ GOOD CONSTRAINTS:
tree:
  max_depth: 6                  # ✅ Matches paper
  min_samples_split: 8          # ✅ Good balance
  min_samples_leaf: 3           # ✅ Prevents overfitting
