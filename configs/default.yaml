# GA Configuration - UPDATED WITH OPTIMAL PARAMETERS
ga:
  population_size: 50          # Reduced from 100 - faster convergence
  n_generations: 30            # Reduced from 50 - sufficient evolution
  crossover_prob: 0.7
  mutation_prob: 0.2
  tournament_size: 3
  elitism_ratio: 0.15          # Increased from 0.1 - preserve more elites
  
  # Mutation probabilities (must sum to 1.0) - UPDATED
  mutation_types:
    threshold_perturbation: 0.5    # Increased from 0.4
    feature_replacement: 0.3
    prune_subtree: 0.15            # Increased pruning focus
    expand_leaf: 0.05              # Reduced expansion

# Tree Constraints
tree:
  max_depth: 5
  min_samples_split: 10
  min_samples_leaf: 5
  max_features: null  # null means all features

# Fitness Configuration - MAJOR UPDATES (THE SECRET SAUCE)
fitness:
  mode: weighted_sum  # 'weighted_sum' or 'pareto'
  
  # Weights for weighted_sum mode - OPTIMAL BALANCE
  weights:
    accuracy: 0.65         # Reduced from 0.7 - better interpretability tradeoff
    interpretability: 0.35  # Increased from 0.3 - stronger size penalty
  
  # Interpretability sub-weights - OPTIMAL MIX
  interpretability_weights:
    node_complexity: 0.6    # Increased from 0.4 - HEAVY emphasis on small trees
    feature_coherence: 0.2  # Reduced from 0.3 - still important
    tree_balance: 0.1       # Reduced from 0.2 - less emphasis on perfect balance
    semantic_coherence: 0.1 # Same - encourages prediction consistency
